> The history of Russia begins with the histories of the East Slavs. 
> The traditional start date of specifically Russian history is the establishment of the Rus' state 
> in the north in the year 862, ruled by Varangians. 
> 
> In 882, Prince Oleg of Novgorod seized Kiev, 
> uniting the northern and southern lands of the Eastern Slavs under one authority, 
> moving the governance center to Kiev by the end of the 10th century, 
> and maintaining northern and southern parts with significant autonomy from each other. 
> 
> The state adopted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire in 988, 
> beginning the **synthesis of Byzantine, Slavic and Scandinavian cultures** 
> that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. 
> 
> Kievan Rus' ultimately disintegrated as a state due to the Mongol invasions in 1237–1240. 
> After the 13th century, Moscow emerged as a significant political and cultural force, 
> driving the unification of Russian territories. 
> 
> By the end of the 15th century, many of the petty principalities around Moscow 
> had been united with the Grand Duchy of Moscow, 
> which took full control of its own sovereignty under Ivan the Great.
>
> Ivan the Terrible transformed the Grand Duchy into the Tsardom of Russia in 1547.  
> However, the death of Ivan's son Feodor I without issue in 1598 
> created a succession crisis and led Russia into a period of chaos and civil war 
> known as the Time of Troubles, ending with the coronation of Michael Romanov 
> as the first Tsar of the Romanov dynasty in 1613.  
> 
> During the rest of the seventeenth century, 
> Russia completed the exploration and conquest of Siberia, 
> claiming lands as far as the Pacific Ocean by the end of the century.  
> 
> Domestically, Russia faced numerous uprisings of the various ethnic groups under their control, 
> as exemplified by the Cossack leader Stenka Razin, who led a revolt in 1670–1671. 
> 
> In 1721, in the wake of the Great Northern War, 
> Tsar Peter the Great renamed the state as the Russian Empire; 
> he is also noted for establishing St. Petersburg as the new capital of his Empire, 
> and for his introducing Western European culture to Russia. 
> 
> In 1762, Russia came under the control of Catherine the Great, 
> who continued the westernizing policies of Peter the Great, 
> and ushered in the era of the Russian Enlightenment.  
> 
> Catherine's grandson, Alexander I, repulsed an invasion by the French Emperor Napoleon, 
> leading Russia into the status of one of the great powers.
>
> Peasant revolts intensified during the nineteenth century, 
> culminating with Alexander II abolishing Russian serfdom in 1861. 
> 
> In the following decades, reform efforts such as the Stolypin reforms of 1906–1914, 
> the constitution of 1906, and the State Duma (1906–1917) 
> attempted to open and liberalize the economy and political system, 
> but the emperors refused to relinquish autocratic rule and resisted sharing their power. 
> 
> A combination of economic breakdown, 
> mismanagement over Russia's involvement in World War I, 
> and discontent with the autocratic system of government 
> triggered the Russian Revolution in 1917. 
> 
> The end of the monarchy initially brought into office a coalition of liberals and moderate socialists, 
> but their failed policies led to the October Revolution. 
> In 1922, Soviet Russia, along with the Ukrainian SSR, Byelorussian SSR, 
> and Transcaucasian SFSR signed the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR, 
> officially merging all four republics to form the Soviet Union as a single state. 
> 
> Between 1922 and 1991 the history of Russia essentially became the history of the Soviet Union. 
> During this period, the Soviet Union was one of the victors in World War II 
> after recovering from a surprise invasion in 1941 by Nazi Germany and its collaborators, 
> which had previously signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. 
> 
> The Soviet Union's network of satellite states in Eastern Europe, 
> which were brought into its sphere of influence in the closing stages of World War II, 
> helped the country become a superpower 
> competing with fellow superpower the United States and other Western countries in the Cold War.
>
> By the mid-1980s, 
> with the weaknesses of Soviet economic and political structures becoming acute, 
> Mikhail Gorbachev embarked on major reforms, 
> which eventually led to the weakening of the communist party and dissolution of the Soviet Union, 
> leaving Russia again on its own and marking the start of the history of post-Soviet Russia. 
> 
> The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic renamed itself as the Russian Federation 
> and became the primary successor state to the Soviet Union. 
> Russia retained its nuclear arsenal but lost its superpower status. 
> 
> Scrapping the central planning and state-ownership of property of the Soviet era in the 1990s, 
> new leaders, led by President Vladimir Putin, took political and economic power after 2000 
> and engaged in an assertive foreign policy. 
> 
> Coupled with economic growth, 
> Russia has since regained significant global status as a world power. 
> Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula 
> led to economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. 
> 
> Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine led to significantly expanded sanctions. 
> 
> Under Putin's leadership, corruption in Russia is rated as the worst in Europe, 
> and Russia's human rights situation has been increasingly criticized by international observers.

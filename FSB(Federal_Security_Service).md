> The **Federal Security Service** of the Russian Federation (FSB) is the principal security agency of Russia 
> and the main successor agency to the Soviet Union's KGB; 
> its immediate predecessor was the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FSK), 
> which was reorganized into the FSB in 1995. 
> 
> The three major structural successor components of the former KGB 
> that remain administratively independent of the FSB are 
> - the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), 
> - the Federal Protective Service (FSO), and 
> - the Main Directorate of Special Programs of the President of the Russian Federation (GUSP).
>
> The primary responsibilities are **within the country** and include counter-intelligence, 
> internal and border security, counterterrorism, surveillance 
> and investigating some other types of serious crimes and federal law violations. 
> 
> It is headquartered in Lubyanka Square, Moscow's center, in the main building of the former KGB. 
> The director of the FSB is appointed by and directly answerable to the president of Russia. 
> Being part of Russia's executive branch formally, the FSB has significant, if not decisive, power over it.
>
> In 2003, the FSB's responsibilities were expanded by incorporating the Border Guard Service 
> and a major part of the Federal Agency of Government Communication and Information (FAPSI); 
> this would include intelligence activities in countries that were once members of the Soviet Union, 
> work formerly done by the KGB's Fifth Service. 
> 
> The SVR had in 1992 signed an agreement not to spy on those countries; the FSB had made no such commitment.

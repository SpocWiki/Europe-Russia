> The Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is the civilian foreign intelligence agency of Russia. 
> The SVR succeeded the First Chief Directorate of the KGB in December 1991. 
> The SVR has its headquarters in the Yasenevo District of Moscow 
> with its director reporting directly to the President of the Russian Federation.
>
> Unlike the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), 
> the SVR is tasked with intelligence and espionage activities **outside the Russian Federation**. 
> 
> A small service, it works collaboratively with its military intelligence counterpart, the Main Intelligence Directorate, better known as the GRU. As of 1997, the GRU reportedly deployed six times as many spies in foreign countries as the SVR. The SVR is authorized to negotiate intelligence-sharing arrangements with foreign governments, particularly on matters of counterterrorism, and is tasked with providing finished intelligence products to the Russian president.
>
> Any information pertaining to specific identities of staff employees (officers) of the SVR is considered a state secret; since September 2018, the same protection has applied to non-staff personnel (i.e., agents, informants, or cooptees.)

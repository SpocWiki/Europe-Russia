> Perm Krai (Russian: Пе́рмский край, romanized: Permskiy kray, IPA: [ˈpʲɛrmskʲɪj ˈkraj]; Komi-Permyak: Перем ладор, romanized: Perem lador) 
> is a federal subject of Russia (a krai), located in Eastern Europe. 
> Its administrative center is Perm. 
> The population of the krai was 2,532,405 (2021 Census).
>
> The krai was formed on 1 December 2005 as a result of the 2004 
> referendum on the merger of Perm Oblast and Komi-Permyak Autonomous Okrug. 
> 
> Komi-Permyak Okrug retained its autonomous status within Perm Krai 
> during the transitional period of 2006–2008. 
> 
> It also retained a budget separate from that of the krai, keeping all federal transfers. 
> 
> Starting in 2009, Komi-Permyak Okrug's budget 
> became subject to the budgeting law of Perm Krai. 
> 
> The transitional period was implemented in part 
> because Komi-Permyak Okrug relied heavily on federal subsidies, 
> and an abrupt cut would have been detrimental to its economy. 
>
> The final period of the [[../../../../../Time-Ages/geo~Eons/Eon~4~Phanerozoic/Era~1~Paleozoic|Paleozoic]] era, the Permian, is named after the Perm region.

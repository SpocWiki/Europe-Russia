> **Volgograd**, formerly Tsaritsyn (1589–1925) and Stalingrad (1925–1961), 
> is the largest city and the administrative centre of Volgograd Oblast, Russia. 
> 
> The city lies on the western bank of the Volga, 
> covering an area of 859.4 square kilometres (331.8 square miles), 
> with a population of slightly over one million residents. 
> 
> Volgograd is the 16th-largest city by population size in Russia, 
> the third-largest city of the Southern Federal District, and the fourth-largest city on the Volga.
>
> The city was founded as the fortress of Tsaritsyn in 1589. 
> By the 19th century, Tsaritsyn had become an important river-port and commercial centre, 
> leading to its rapid population growth. 
> 
> In November 1917, at the start of the Russian Civil War, Tsaritsyn came under Bolshevik control. 
> It fell briefly to the White Army in mid-1919 but returned to Bolshevik control in January 1920. 
> 
> In 1925, the city was renamed Stalingrad in honor of Joseph Stalin, 
> who took part in defending the city against the White Army who had then ruled the country. 
> 
> During World War II, Axis forces attacked the city, leading to the Battle of Stalingrad, 
> the largest and bloodiest battle in World War II, from which it received the title of Hero City. 
> 
> The Soviet victory at Stalingrad is widely held to be the turning point of World War II, 
> leading to the destruction of the German army in the East. 
> In 1961, Nikita Khrushchev's administration renamed the city to Volgograd as part of de-Stalinization.
>
> Volgograd today is the site of The Motherland Calls, 
> an 85-metre (279 ft) high statue dedicated to the heroes of the Battle of Stalingrad, 
> which is the tallest statue in Europe, as well as the second tallest statue of a woman in the world. 
> 
> The city has many tourist attractions, such as museums, sandy beaches, 
> and a self-propelled floating church. 
> 
> Volgograd was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

> The **Gulag** was a system of forced labor camps in the Soviet Union. 
> The word Gulag originally referred only to the division of the Soviet secret police 
> that was in charge of running the forced labor camps from the 1930s to the early 1950s 
> during Joseph Stalin's rule, but in English literature 
> the term is popularly used for the system of forced labor throughout the Soviet era. 
> 
> The abbreviation GULAG (ГУЛАГ) stands for "Glávnoye upravléniye ispravítel'no-trudovýkh lageréy " (Гла́вное управле́ние исправи́тельно-трудовы́х лагере́й or 
> "Main Directorate of Correctional Labour Camps"), 
> but the full official name of the agency changed several times.
>
> The Gulag is recognized as a major instrument of political repression in the Soviet Union. 
> The camps housed both ordinary criminals and political prisoners, 
> a large number of whom were convicted by simplified procedures, 
> such as NKVD troikas or other instruments of extrajudicial punishment. 
> 
> The agency was established in 1930 and initially was administered by the OGPU (1923–1934), 
> later known as the NKVD (1934–1946) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) in the final years. 
>
> The internment system grew rapidly, reaching a population of 100,000 in the 1920s. 
> By the end of 1940, the population of the Gulag camps amounted to 1.5 million. 
> 
> The emergent consensus among scholars is that of the 
> 14 million prisoners who passed through the Gulag camps and the 
> 4 million prisoners who passed through the Gulag colonies from 1930 to 1953, 
> roughly 1.5 to 1.7 million prisoners perished there or died soon after they were released. 
> 
> Some journalists and writers who question the reliability of such data 
> heavily rely on memoir sources that come to higher estimations. 
> Archival researchers have found "no plan of destruction" of the Gulag population 
> and no statement of official intent to kill them, 
> and prisoner releases vastly exceeded the number of deaths in the Gulag. 
> This policy can partially be attributed to the common practice of releasing prisoners 
> who were suffering from incurable diseases as well as prisoners who were near death.
>
> Almost immediately after the death of Stalin, 
> the Soviet establishment started to dismantle the Gulag system. 
> A mass general amnesty was granted in the immediate aftermath of Stalin's death, 
> but it was only offered to non-political prisoners 
> and political prisoners who had been sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison. 
> 
> Shortly thereafter, Nikita Khrushchev was elected First Secretary, 
> initiating the processes of de-Stalinization and the Khrushchev Thaw, 
> triggering a mass release and rehabilitation of political prisoners. 
> 
> Six years later, on January 25, 1960, the Gulag system was officially abolished 
> when the remains of its administration were dissolved by Khrushchev. 
> The legal practice of sentencing convicts to penal labor continues to exist in the Russian Federation, 
> but its capacity is greatly reduced.
>
> Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, 
> who survived eight years of Gulag incarceration, gave the term its international repute 
> with the publication of The Gulag Archipelago in 1973. 
> 
> The author likened the scattered camps to "a chain of islands", and as an eyewitness, 
> he described the Gulag as a system where people were worked to death. 
> 
> In March 1940, there were 53 Gulag camp directorates (simply referred to as "camps") 
> and 423 labor colonies in the Soviet Union. 
> 
> Many mining and industrial towns and cities in northern Russia, eastern Russia and Kazakhstan—
> such as Karaganda, Norilsk, Vorkuta and Magadan—
> originated as blocks of camps built by prisoners and subsequently run by ex-prisoners.

> Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin (21 January [O.S. 9 Jan] 1869 – 30 December [O.S. 17 Dec] 1916) 
> was a Russian mystic and faith healer. 
> He is best known for having befriended the imperial family of Nicholas II, the last Emperor of Russia, 
> through whom he gained considerable influence in the final years of the Russian Empire.
>
> Rasputin was born to a family of peasants in the Siberian village of Pokrovskoye, 
> located within Tyumensky Uyezd in Tobolsk Governorate 
> (present-day Yarkovsky District in Tyumen Oblast). 
> 
> He had a religious conversion experience after embarking on a pilgrimage to a monastery in 1897 
> and has been described as a monk or as a strannik (wanderer or pilgrim), 
> though he held no official position in the Russian Orthodox Church. 
> In 1903 or in the winter of 1904–1905, he travelled to Saint Petersburg 
> and captivated several religious and social leaders, 
> eventually becoming a prominent figure in Russian society. 
> In November 1905, Rasputin met Nicholas II and his empress consort, Alexandra Feodorovna.
>
> In late 1906, Rasputin began acting as a faith healer for Nicholas' and Alexandra's only son, 
> Alexei Nikolaevich, who suffered from haemophilia. 
> He was a divisive figure at court, seen by some Russians as a mystic, visionary, and prophet, 
> and by others as a religious charlatan. 
> The extent of Rasputin's power reached an all-time high in 1915, 
> when Nicholas left Saint Petersburg to oversee the Imperial Russian Army 
> as it was engaged in the First World War. 
> 
> In his absence, Rasputin and Alexandra consolidated their influence across the Russian Empire. 
> However, as Russian military defeats mounted on the Eastern Front, 
> both figures became increasingly unpopular. 
> In the early morning of 30 December [O.S. 17 December] 1916, 
> Rasputin was assassinated by a group of conservative Russian noblemen 
> who opposed his influence over the imperial family.
>
> Historians often suggest that Rasputin's scandalous and sinister reputation 
> helped discredit the Tsarist government, 
> thus precipitating the overthrow of the House of Romanov shortly after his assassination. 
> 
> Accounts of his life and influence were often based on common rumors; 
> he remains a mysterious and captivating figure in popular culture.

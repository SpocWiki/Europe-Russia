> Moscow Oblast (Russian: Московская область, romanized: Moskovskaya oblastʹ, IPA: [mɐˈskofskəjə ˈobləsʲtʲ], 
> informally known as Подмосковье, Podmoskovye, IPA: [pədmɐˈskovʲjə]) 
> is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). 
> 
> With a population of 8,524,665 (2021 Census) living in an area of 44,300 square kilometers (17,100 sq mi), it is one of the most densely populated regions in the country and is the second most populous federal subject. The oblast has no official administrative center; its public authorities are located in Moscow and Krasnogorsk (the Moscow Oblast Duma and the local government), and also across other locations in the oblast.
>
> Located in European Russia between latitudes 54° and 57° N and longitudes 35° and 41° E, Moscow Oblast borders Tver Oblast in the northwest, Yaroslavl Oblast in the north, Vladimir Oblast in the northeast and east, Ryazan Oblast in the southeast, Tula Oblast in the south, Kaluga Oblast in the southwest, and Smolensk Oblast in the west. The oblast mostly surrounds the federal city of Moscow, which is not part of the oblast, but rather a separate federal subject in its own right. The oblast is highly industrialized, with the major industries being metallurgy, oil refining, and mechanical engineering, along with the food, energy, and chemical industries.

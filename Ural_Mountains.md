> The Ural Mountains (YOOR-əl), or simply the Urals, 
> are a mountain range in Eurasia that runs north–south mostly through Russia, 
> from the coast of the Arctic Ocean to the river Ural and northwestern Kazakhstan. 
> 
> The mountain range forms part of the conventional boundary 
> between the continents of Europe and Asia, 
> marking the separation between European Russia and Siberia. 
> 
> Vaygach Island and the islands of Novaya Zemlya form continuations of the chain to the north into the Arctic Ocean. The average altitudes of the Urals are around 1,000–1,300 metres (3,300–4,300 ft), the highest point being Mount Narodnaya, which reaches a height of 1,894 metres (6,214 ft).
>
> The mountains lie within the Ural geographical region and significantly overlap with the Ural Federal District and the Ural economic region. Their resources include metal ores, coal, precious and semi-precious stones. Since the 18th century, the mountains have contributed significantly to the mineral sector of the Russian economy. The region is one of the largest centers of metallurgy and heavy industry production in Russia.

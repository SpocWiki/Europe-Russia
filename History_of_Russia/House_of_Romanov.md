## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The House of Romanov (also transliterated as Romanoff. Russian: Романовы, romanized: 
> Romanovy, IPA: [rɐˈmanəvɨ]) was the reigning imperial house of Russia from 1613 to 1917. 
> 
> They achieved prominence after Anastasia Romanovna married Ivan the Terrible, 
> the first crowned tsar of all Russia. 
> Nicholas II, the last Emperor of Russia, and his immediate family were executed in 1918, 
> but there are still living descendants of other members of the imperial house.
>
> The house consisted of boyars in Russia (the highest rank in the Russian nobility at the time) 
> under the reigning Rurik dynasty, which became extinct upon the death of Feodor I in 1598. 
> The Time of Troubles, caused by the resulting succession crisis, 
> saw several pretenders and imposters lay claim to the Russian throne 
> during the Polish-Lithuanian occupation. 
> On 21 February 1613, the Zemsky Sobor elected Michael Romanov as tsar, 
> establishing the Romanovs as Russia's second reigning dynasty.
>
> Michael's grandson, Peter I, who took the title of emperor 
> and proclaimed the Russian Empire in 1721, transformed the country into a great power 
> through a series of wars and reforms. 
> 
> The direct male line of the Romanovs ended when Elizabeth died childless in 1762. 
> As a result, her nephew Peter III, an agnatic member of the House of Holstein-Gottorp 
> (a cadet branch of the German House of Oldenburg that reigned in Denmark), 
> ascended to the throne and adopted his Romanov mother's house name. 
> Officially known as members of the House of Romanov, 
> descendants after Elizabeth are sometimes referred to as Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov.
>
> Paul I became the first heir to the throne, having the title tsesarevich, 
> which was subsequently used for all main heirs.
>
> The abdication of Nicholas II on 15 March [O.S. 2 March] 1917 
> as a result of the February Revolution ended 304 years of Romanov rule 
> and led to the establishment of the Russian Republic under the Russian Provisional Government 
> in the lead-up to the Russian Civil War of 1917–1922. 
> 
> In 1918, the Bolsheviks executed Nicholas II and his family. 
> Of the House of Romanov's 65 members, 47 survivors went into exile abroad. 
> In 1924, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, 
> the senior surviving male-line descendant of Alexander II of Russia by primogeniture, 
> claimed the headship of the defunct Imperial House of Russia.

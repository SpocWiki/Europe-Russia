> The Committee for State Security (Russian: Комитет государственной безопасности, romanized: Komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti, IPA: [kəmʲɪˈtʲed ɡəsʊˈdarstvʲɪn(ː)əj bʲɪzɐˈpasnəsʲtʲɪ]), 
> abbreviated as **KGB** (Russian: КГБ, IPA: [ˌkɛɡɛˈbɛ]; ) 
> was the main security agency of the Soviet Union from 1954 to 1991. 
> 
> It was the direct successor of preceding Soviet secret police agencies including 
> the Cheka, OGPU, and NKVD and succeeded by the [[FSB(Federal_Security_Service)]] . 
> 
> Attached to the Council of Ministers, 
> it was the chief government agency of "union-republican jurisdiction", 
> carrying out internal security, foreign intelligence, counter-intelligence and secret police functions. 
> 
> Similar agencies operated in each of the republics of the Soviet Union aside from the Russian SFSR, 
> where the KGB was headquartered, with many associated ministries, state committees and state commissions.
>
> The agency was a military service governed by army laws and regulations, 
> in the same fashion as the Soviet Army or the MVD Internal Troops. 
> 
> While most of the KGB archives remain classified, two online documentary sources are available. 
> Its main functions were foreign intelligence, counter-intelligence, operative-investigative activities, 
> guarding the state border of the USSR, guarding the Soviet leadership, 
> preserving the security of government communications 
> as well as combating dissident and separatism within Soviet society. 
>
> On 3 December 1991, the KGB was officially dissolved. 
> It was succeeded in Russia by the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) 
> and what would later become the Federal Security Service (FSB). 
> 
> Following the 1991–1992 South Ossetia War, 
> the self-proclaimed Republic of South Ossetia established its own KGB, 
> keeping the unreformed name. 
> 
> In addition, Belarus established its successor to the KGB of the Byelorussian SSR in 1991, 
> the Belarusian KGB, also keeping the unreformed name.
